            The PCIe x1 slot is an extension or additional slot provided by the motherboard manufacturers to be used for additional peripheral devices that the user might want to install on their system. There are many varieties of PCIe generations and slots. The PCIe is a successor of the PCI protocol and is much faster than it. The throughput of the PCIe slot depends on the number of lanes it uses to transfer the bits of data. The PCIe x1 slot is the smallest in size and provides the lowest throughput out of all other implementations of the PCIe. An empty PCIe x1 slot can be used for multiple purposes, such as extending storage or adding a Network Interface Card or a sound card, etc.
