A liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor is a computer monitor or display that uses LCD technology to show clear images, and is found mostly in laptop computers and flat panel monitors. This technology has replaced the traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors, which were the previous standard and once were considered to have better picture quality than early LCD variants. With the introduction of better LCD technology and its continuous improvement, LCD is now the clear leader over CRT, in terms of color and picture quality, not to mention capabilities for large resolutions. Also, LCD monitors may be made much more cheaply than CRT monitors.
