        <p>
The Southbridge controls the slower I/O or in-and-out devices. These include all hard drive and expansion slots, USB, FireWire, RAID, audio codecs, real-time system clock, system power management, interrupt controller, direct memory access (DMA) controller, and nonvolatile BIOS memory. The Southbridge chip is sometimes referred to as the I/O Controller Hub (ICH), or Platform Controller Hub (PCH). In legacy mainboard designs every different device the Southbridge now handles used to be controlled by a discreet chip on the motherboard. Combining these into one chip to rule them all saved real estate and manufacturing costs. The various linkages or data pathways between chips and components on the motherboard are referred to as buses. A motherboard with a faster bus speed will be quicker than a motherboard with a slower bus speed, all else being equal.
