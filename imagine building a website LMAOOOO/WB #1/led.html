            Short for light-emitting diode monitor, an LED monitor or LED display is a flat screen, flat-panel computer monitor or television. It has a very short depth and is light in terms of weight. The actual difference between this and a typical LCD monitor is the backlighting. The first LCD monitors used CCFL instead of LEDs to illuminate the screen.

            The first LED display is generally considered to have been developed by James P. Mitchell in 1977. The first LED display prototype was shown to the public at the SEF (Science and Engineering Fair) in Iowa on March 18, 1978. It was shown again at the SEF in Anaheim California on May 8, 1978. The prototype was 1/4-inch thick and received awards from General Motors and NASA.
