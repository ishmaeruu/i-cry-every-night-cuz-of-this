            The computer case serves mainly as a way to physically mount and contain all the actual components inside a computer, like the motherboard, hard drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, etc. They typically come bundled with a power supply.
            The housing of a laptop, netbook, or tablet is also considered a case, but since they aren't purchased separately or very replaceable, the computer case tends to refer to the one that's part of a traditional desktop PC.

        Motherboards, computer cases, and power supplies all come in different sizes called form factors. All three must be compatible to work properly together. Many computer cases, especially ones made of metal, contain very sharp edges. Be very careful when working with an open case to avoid serious cuts. When a computer repair person says "just bring the computer in," they are typically referring to the case and what's inside it, excluding any external keyboard, mouse, monitor, or other peripherals.
