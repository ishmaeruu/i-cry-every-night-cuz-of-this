A solid-state drive (SSD) is a new generation of storage device used in computers. SSDs use flash-based memory, which is much faster than a traditional mechanical hard disk. Upgrading to an SSD is one of the best ways to speed up your computer. Learn how SSDs work and how to keep them optimized with a specialized performance-boosting tool.

        SSDs store data permanently on an integrated circuit, which is a collection of electronic circuits embedded within a silicon semiconductor cell. Sometimes referred to as semiconductor storage devices, SSDs are more commonly known as solid-state drives, because they don’t have the moving parts found in hard-disk drives (HDD). Because SSD flash memory can be written, transferred, and erased electronically, SSDs run much faster and more quietly than HDDs. But they’re also more expensive and have more limited storage capacity than HDDs. SSDs are often used on high-end machines or as secondary storage devices on consumer PCs.
